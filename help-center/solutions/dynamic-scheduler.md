description: How our Dynamic Scheduler assigns routes to drivers and assets
---
Dynamic Scheduler is Copilot's unique scheduler to assign your routes to your drivers and assets so that it maximizes efficiency while adhering to the following parameters:

## Driver Availability

Copilot gathers driver availability based on:

- Their assigned routes in Copilot

- Their Time Off records defined in the Time Off Tracker tab

- Their active status defined in the Driver Roster tab

## Driver Shift Preferences

Dynamic Scheduler will assign routes to available drivers only if the route matches the shift start preferences defined in the Driver Roster. The Shift Start preferences can be defined through the following fields:

- Work Days

- Shift Start Time (From and To)

For example, if you set a driver's Work Days as M, T, W and Shift Start Time to range from 12:00 to 15:00, Dynamic Scheduler will assign a route that starts on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday between the hours of 12:00 to 15:00.

## FMCSA Regulations

Dynamic Scheduler will make sure all route assignments adhere to the [FMCSA Hours of Service Regulations](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-service/summary-hours-service-regulations).

## Asset Availability

Copilot gathers asset availability based on:

- Their assigned routes in Copilot (including MAINT routes)

- Their active status defined in the Assets tab
